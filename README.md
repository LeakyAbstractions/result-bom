# Result Library BOM

This project contains [Bill of Materials (BOM) POM][BILL_OF_MATERIALS] for [Result libraries][RESULT], which is a
special POM file that groups dependency versions that are known to be valid and tested to work together, reducing the
chances to have version mismatches.

The basic idea is that, instead of specifying a version number for every Result library that you want to use in your
project, you can use this BOM POM to get a full set of consistent versions to use.
